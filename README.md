# Tunbridge Wells Quarantine Delivery

A website to help independent shops delivering during the coronavirus crisis

## Architecture

Built off a [Lambda function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) which uses the Google API to fetch data from a spreadsheet. An endpoint should be integrated into `index.svelte`.

The front-end is built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
